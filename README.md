# ml_cs231n_cpp

This repository contains C++ implementation of the SVM and Softmax loss functions in addition to the simple two-layer Neural Network.
They were developed for visualization and understanding while doing CS231n from Stanford University in 2016.

This project contains:

1. Implementation of the SVM and Softmax loss [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrRTKM8xJaA)
2. Implementation of the 2 layer neural network [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHpu8N18aRs)
3. Multiple normalization possibilities (mean subtraction, normalization, standardization)
4. Adam weight update
5. Fisher–Yates shuffle algorithm for batching
6. Simple ensemble executable that loads saved weights from the network training and averages at test time
