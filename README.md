# ml_cs231n_cpp

This repository contains C++ implementation of the SVM and Softmax loss functions in addition to the simple two-layer Neural Network.
They were developed for visualization and understanding while doing CS231n from Stanford University in 2016.

This project contains:

1. Implementation of the SVM and Softmax loss [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrRTKM8xJaA)
2. Implementation of the 2 layer neural network [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHpu8N18aRs)
3. Multiple normalization possibilities (mean subtraction, normalization, standardization)
4. Adam weight update
5. Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle algorithm for batching
6. Simple ensemble executable that loads saved weights from the network training and averages at test time

# Dependencies

The project depends on having either Qt4 or Qt5 lib.
It was tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with g++ 7.3.0

# Clone & Build

The build should go as usual with CMake

```
git clone https://github.com/Logrus/ml_cs231n_cpp.git
cd ml_cs231n_cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
# Run
Before you can experiment, you should upload CIFAR10 dataset by running a script:
```
# From ml_cs231n_cpp folder
./get_datasets.sh
```
It will create a `data/CIFAR10` folder in the current folder and download bin files to CIFAR10 folder.

Note: Don't hesitate to change `get_datasets.sh` script if you want to download files to another place.

After compilation you can SVM and Softmax visualizations:
```
# From build folder call
./visualizer
```
In the open window click on `Open dataset` button and specify path to CIFAR10 folder (e.g. ml_cs231n_cpp/data/CIFAR10).
